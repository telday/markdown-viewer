# CI records the numbers as an informational trend, not a gate (see issue #21

# BenchMarker inside the app emits absolute wall-clock timestamps (seconds
# since the Unix epoch, gated on FOLIUM_BENCH) rather than elapsed durations.
# Cold launch has to be timed from OUTSIDE the process: dyld and AppKit
# start-up happen before any of our Swift code runs, so an in-process
# baseline can never see them. This script takes its own wall-clock reading
# immediately before it execs the app and subtracts that from the
# `first-paint` marker instead.

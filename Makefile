# Folium build & install.

# `make install` builds a release binary, assembles a Folium.app bundle,
# ad-hoc signs it, and copies it to /Applications. See ADR 0002 (SPM build)
# and ADR 0003 (unsandboxed, direct distribution).

# on the command line (`make bundle VERSION=1.2.0`) or from the environment.
# The default is stamped like any other value, so a plain `make install`
# exercises the same path a tagged release build takes.
#
# `override` with `$(or ...)`, rather than `?=`, because a variable set to the
# empty string counts as set: `VERSION= make bundle` — the shape a CI template
# produces when its input is blank — would otherwise stamp an empty version.
# A non-empty value from the command line still wins, since it is what
# `$(VERSION)` expands to here.

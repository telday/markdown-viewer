# The default is stamped like any other value, so a plain `make install`
# exercises the same path a tagged release build takes.
#
# `override` with `$(or ...)`, rather than `?=`, because a variable set to the
# empty string counts as set: `VERSION= make bundle` — the shape a CI template

# A non-empty value from the command line still wins, since it is what
# `$(VERSION)` expands to here.
